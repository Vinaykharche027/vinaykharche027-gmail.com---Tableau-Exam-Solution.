Q1 : Explain in detail the area graphs and line graphs in tableau and how to create them with
examples.
Ans : 
area graph : 
   area graph is generally used for the presenting cummulative values. basically it show differnt values change over time with the area under the coloured line.
   For example, you can use an area graph to show how the sales of different products have changed over time.
 To create an area graph in Tableau we have to follow some steps :
  1: In the first steps you have to drag date into columns shelf and measures which you want to plot need to put in row shelf.
  2: In the Second step click on the Show me and select the chart type ("Area").
  3: In the third steps you have to select defferent colur to make in informative and attractive also, which help to differentiate between the product.
there are two types of area chart in the tableau which are "Area chart (continuous)" and "Area chart (discrete).
they both are divided on the x-axis in the Area chart Continuous use the continuous range of data on the x-axis, while area chart discrete uses distinct categoies nad groups.

Line graph : 
	line graph is the graph is used to represent the point or graph which is connected by the line.
	for example if you want to see the imporvent of the students marks in every year there we can use the line graph.
	we plot all the percentage of of the student on the graph after that we will connect it by a line it is known as line graph.
 To create an Line graph in tableau follow the following steps;
   1: first put Date into the Colum and Measure which you want to plot put it into row
   2: in second step click on show me which present on the right side corner. and click on the Line graph.
   3: for better visulization you change the colour of the line.
there are three types of line graph present in the tableau which are line(continuous), Lines(discrete), dual lines.

in the example i have visulized the car and motorcyle sales data. which in ploted into the line graph and area graph also.

Q2 :  What are the different steps in grouping fields and combining tables in tableau ? Explain withexamples. (With the help of an example create one in tableau).
Ans: 	Grouping is help to combine similar kind of data into a category or group. because of that group or category it simplifies your data analysis, highlights important
	patterns, and makes it easier to create clear and effective visualizations. it also allow to create custom categories that may not be available in your data.
	basically grouping help you to better understand and communicate your data.
Example : if you have a data of movies name and in that data the categories of movie is specified seperatly there we can group by that data of movies by the grouping.
	so that is makes easy to create graphs and charts using that categories.
steps to groupin in tableau:
	1: select the feild which you want to group.
	2: press right click and select create.
	3: from the create click on group.
for grouping more than one feild or column. steps are:
	1: select all the feild which you want to group/combine.(using ctr button).	
	2: press right click.
	3: click on create.
	4: click on combine field. 
Example in tableau: 
1 (Group):
in the example i have created a group of vehicals which is catergoried by the Route, i have created a one group of Vehicals which are run on the road, i have creted a separate group for the Water Route, air and seprated group of trains.
grouping makes easy to plot my sales graph.
2(combine feild) : 
in the example i have combined the month and yearid feild beacause of that it makes easy to plot my sales graph with month and years.

Q3: What is the use of color and size options in the marks cart of tableau ? (With the help of an
example create one in tableau).
ANS : The color and size options in Tableau's Marks card are used to visually enhance data representation. Color is used to visually distinguish between categorical data,
 while size is used to represent numerical data. By using these options, Tableau allows users to create more visually striking and easy-to-understand visualizations.
In the Tableau graph i have plot a packet bubble type of graph in which i have specified tha different colour to each circle and also each circle denoting the each type of state.
the size of circle showing the sales of the graph. we can specify the colour from the mark card.

Q4: What are the different joins supported by tableau? 
ANS: joins are used to combine data from two or more tables into a single table for analysis and visualization purposes. Inner join only includes rows with matching values in both tables, left join includes all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, right join includes all the rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table, and full outer join includes all rows from both tables, even if there are no matches in either table.
     Tableau support  inner, left, right, and full outer joins.
	Inner Join : 
		 It returns the records (or rows) present in both tables If there is at least one match between columns
	Left Join : 
		This Tableau Join returns all the records (or rows) in the Left table and matching rows from the right.
	Right Join : 
		 It returns all the records (or rows) present in the Right table and matches rows from the Left one.
	Full Outer Join:
		 It returns all the records (or rows) in both the Left and right tables. All the Unmatched rows will fill with NULL Values.
	For the join you have to follow steps:
		1: Connect data on which you want on to perform a task on it
		2: then add sheet on the canvas 
		3: double click on that sheet 
		4: after that add another sheet which you want to join. you can edit or customize join.

Q5: Explain the steps to create dashboard in tableau with example.
ANS: 	Dashboard is basically the way to present all the insights in one sheet.
	Dashboard is used for presenting data in one sheet with the intracting way, you can also create a Dynamic dashboards using tableau which have the options and they change there insight by the requirement whithout change there main arrangment in the Dashboards.
	To create an Dashboard we have to follow the following steps such as : 
	1. add connection/ Data source.
	2. plot a graphs or create a insights into the sheet.
	3. after create a dashboard and add the insights in it.
	4 arrange it in a relevant manner. 
	Basically in the Dashboard we connect all the sheet in the one sheet.
Example:
	in the Example of tableau dashboard i have create on dashboard of previous Questions Solution.

Q6 : Explain in detail the heat maps and scatter plot and how to create them with example.
ANS :	Heat Map: Heatmap is defined as a graphical representation of data using colors to visualize the value of the matrix. In this to represent more common values or higher activities brighter colors basically reddish colors are used and to less common or activity values darker colors are preferred. Heatmap is also defined by the name of the shading matrix.
	Scatter plot :As the name suggests, a scatter plot shows many points scattered in the Cartesian plane. It is created by plotting values of numerical variables as X and Y coordinates in the Cartesian plane. Tableau takes at least one measure in the Rows shelf and one measure in the Columns shelf to create a scatter plot. However, we can add dimension fields to the scatter plot which play a role in marking different colors for the already existing points in the scatter graph
	scatter plot is generally used to see the parameter which are overlapping each other.
	to create an Heat map steps are:
		1. connect the data.
		2. add measure and dimension on which you want to plot a graph.
		3. click on show me.
		4. click on the heat map.

	To create an Scatter plot : 
		1. connect data with the tableau.
		2. add measure and dimension in the rows and column where you want to perform a task.
		3. click on show me and then click on the scatter plot.

Example : Heat Map:
		i have plot a heat map which is showing the sales of diffrent vehicals using tableau.
	Scatter Plot:
		here i have plot a scatter plot which is showing the sales, quantity sales and price per vehical using tableau.

Q7: How to create table calculations in tableau with examples.
ANS:	Table calculations in Tableau can be performed using a variety of functions such as running total, percent difference, moving average, rank, and many more. These functions can help you gain insights into your data and make informed decisions.
	table calculations allow you to perform complex calculations on your data in real-time, without the need for manual intervention.
	steps :
		1. add the measure on markcard
		2. right click
		3. click on the table calculation (there are already predefined function also there to use them click on quick table calculation or if you want to write a function by yourself for that click on "Add Table Calculation".
Example: 
	in the table calculation i have calculated the Sales of vehical in every month in percentage using table function.


Q8: Explain in detail the distribution bands in tableau and how to create them with example.
ANS: 	In Tableau, distribution bands are used to group a continuous variable into discrete segments, or bins. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that may have a wide range of values. By creating distribution bands, you can visualize data more easily and identify patterns and trends.
	To create distribution bands in Tableau, follow steps:
		1.Drag the continuous variable you want to bin onto the Rows or Columns shelf.
		2.go into the analytical section which is present on the left side upper corner.
		3.From the custom section click on the Distribution band.
		4.Custom the feild as per your requirement.

Q9: Explain the steps to create bar chart and pie diagram in tableau with example.
ANS:	Creating a Bar Chart in Tableau:
		1. Open Tableau and connect to your data source
		2. Drag the dimension you want to measure to the Columns shelf
		3. Drag the measure you want to chart to the Rows shelf
		4. Tableau will automatically create a bar chart. You can customize the chart by adding labels, colors, and formatting options from the Marks card.
	Creating a Pie Chart in Tableau:
		1. Open Tableau and connect to your data source
		2. Drag the dimension you want to measure to the "Angle" field in the Marks card
		3. Drag the measure you want to chart to the "Size" field in the Marks card
		4. Tableau will automatically create a pie chart.(If not created then click on show me and then click on pie chart.) You can customize the chart by adding labels, colors, and formatting options from the Marks card.
Example : Let's say you have a dataset of sales by region for a particular product. You want to create a bar chart to compare the sales for each region.
	Open Tableau and connect to your data source
	Drag the "Region" dimension to the Columns shelf
	Drag the "Sales" measure to the Rows shelf
	Tableau will automatically create a bar chart showing the sales for each region
	You can customize the chart by adding labels, colors, and formatting options from the Marks card. For example, you can add labels to show the exact sales values for each region, or change the color scheme to highlight the highest or lowest sales.
	To create a pie chart instead, follow the steps outlined above for creating a pie chart. Drag the "Region" dimension to the "Angle" field and the "Sales" measure to the "Size" field in the Marks card. Tableau will automatically create a pie chart showing the proportion of sales for each region.	
Example (Tableau): in the tableau example i have create a bar chart and pie diagram for the sales of the vehicals in different region.
